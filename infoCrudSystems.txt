If you're like me and you have a desk job, then you almost certainly use a lot of information systems.
There's a metric butt-tonne of them and it's confusing to keep track of them all.
They're mostly accessed using chrome or some other web browser, and they have a dirty little secret.

Under the surface, the software is almost exactly the same.

Doesn't matter if it's written with different programming languages, different architectures, tech stacks, whatever. They're fundamentally doing the same thing.

Here's the basics of these systems:

1. You create, read, update and delete the things you put into this system (CRUD for short)
  1a. Sometimes these records you put in have workflows or processes or transformations or stages that they go through i.e. a loan application for a house
2. You set rules about who can get in and do what - authentication/authorisation
3. bulk import/export of data/records
4. backup, disaster recovery (usually comes by default with cloud providers)

If the publishers/vendors are smart, they'll put a few more things in:

5. report and monitor with common requests as default, with full report coverage available, i.e. users can create reports and alerts on anything
6. self serve as much as possible
7. API coverage of all end user functionality, i.e. if I can see it on the screen, it should be in an API so programmers can automate stuff with it

They all have 3 or 4 letter acronyms: CRM, CSM, RMS, CMS, ITSM, AMS etc etc. The MS usually stands for "management system".
Because they're all the same, I kind of expect these things to just *be there from the start*.
I've gotten to the point where I believe all these features should just be included upfront, in the price tag.

If 4, 6 and 7 were in every system, the entire world would run at least 9999% more efficiently, I bet.

Maybe a digital economist could do an actual study and find out.
