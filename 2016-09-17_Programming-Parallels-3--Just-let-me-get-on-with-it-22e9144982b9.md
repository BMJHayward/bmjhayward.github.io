It’s like writing a song…

I don’t know when I’ll be finished. Asking me how long until it’s ready is counter-productive.

My band manager doesn’t set deadlines. Neither does the producer, nor the record label executives.

I write until I’m done.

Then I practice, edit. Improve. Throw stuff out. Put stuff in.

Trial it out with a few people in a small dingy pub.

Builders get to use the same tools, the same materials, making the same things, the same way, for many years. This allows project estimates to become accurate _and_ precise.

Not so with the computers. Not so.

I’m thinking it might be smart to only put programmers on a project if it’s worth doing no matter how long it takes. I.e. the cost of production is far outweighed by the benefit of the final product.
